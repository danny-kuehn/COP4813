          Hello! My name is <strong>Daniel Kuehn</strong>. I’m pursuing a
          <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong>
          at <strong>Daytona State College</strong>. This site is part of my
          <strong>COP4813</strong> coursework and highlights foundational skills
          in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coursework, I’m an
          <strong>Arch Linux user (btw)</strong> and I spend a lot of time
          tinkering with development environments. My favorite programming
          languages are <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Bash</strong>, and
          <strong>Java</strong>, since I enjoy the mix of scripting, automation,
          and structured problem-solving they offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me playing
          <strong>Old School RuneScape</strong> and listening to
          <strong>trance music</strong>. Both help me relax and recharge after
          working on projects or assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Want to get in touch? Head over to my
          <a href="/contact">Contact page</a> for my email and GPG key.

        <h2>My Cat</h2>
        <figure>
          <img

            alt="A photo of Jeff, my orange cat, sitting in the backyard."

        <p>
          This is my cat <strong>Jeff</strong>. He used to appear on the home
          page, but he’s moved here so the index can focus on assignments and
          course links.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeff is a very good boy — though he definitely enjoys causing a little
          mayhem from time to time.
