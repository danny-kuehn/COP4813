        <p>
          This website was created as part of
          <strong>COP4813 – Web Systems I</strong> at
          <strong>Daytona State College</strong>. It serves as my personal
          project portfolio for the course, showcasing assignments and hands-on
          exercises that demonstrate my growing skills in front-end and back-end
          web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the semester, I will be applying concepts such as HTML5
          structure, CSS design and responsiveness, JavaScript for
          interactivity, and server-side integration. Each project highlights
          not only technical implementation but also problem-solving,
          creativity, and adherence to industry best practices. The goal of this
          site is to document my progress and provide a clear reference for what
          I’ve learned in web systems.
